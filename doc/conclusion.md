# Conclusion

As a conclusion I can say that I really enjoyed working on this challenge. What felt very motivating to me is the fact that the problem is quite simple to explain but wide in term of possible solutions to explore.

The Streamer-Bundler-Reviewer workflow that I propose seems to me a good way to implement new ideas quickly and test them within the same framework. I really feel like this could be only the beginning of a full work instead of a completed challenge.

On another topic, it was the first time that I developed a dashboard on Streamlit (and also first time that I deploy an app on Heroky). The Streamlit project has been released a few months ago only and I found it very easy to handle. I have had some technical complications using it but I am sure that it can become a day-to-day tool to use.
