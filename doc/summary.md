# App pages :
- **Data exploration** : Section in which I explore the notification dataset. It contains some numbers and figures that helped me understand what the challenge was about.
- **Components presentation** : My code is separated into several components each meeting a specific need. Core components are a Streamer to load and stream the notifications, different Bundlers (grouping algorithms) to bundle notifications as they come and a Reviewer that measures the performances of the algorithm.
- **Interactive tests** : This section is the testing area. It helped me to easily test and compare the different algorithms I implemented.
- **Solution tool**: Page to upload and process an unseen dataset. Results can be exported but are limited to first 5k rows due to technical issues.
- **Performances** : Compiled performances of every algorithms.
- **Conclusion** : A small conclusion about this challenge.
